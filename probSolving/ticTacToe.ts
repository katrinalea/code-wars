/* Write a function `calcWinState` to take a representation of a tictactoe (noughts and crosses) board ( `BoardState`) and return the status (`WinStatus`):

either

- there was a draw;
- or the game has not been finished yet;
- or a player won (indicate the winning player)

Assume all input board states are legal (e.g. no board has winning rows by BOTH players).

Assume, for simplicity, that `type Player = "X" | "O"`

### Designing representations

- You will have to design the representation of the board state.  Keep it simple.   Coordinates representing (x, y) or (column,row) are **not** actually required.

- You will have to design the return type to be able to represent the three states.

Note: In the case of a win, you donâ€™t have to report *where* the winning row is, only which player won. */

type WinState = "draw" | "X Won" | "O Won" | "not finished";
